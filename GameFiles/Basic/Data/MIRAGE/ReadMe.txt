 - Increased the weapon stats of many wild animals, and hp for a few (the list is too long, but obviously those, which should be dangerous in reality)
 - Reduced the max distance the finishing move can be initiated from 20 meters to 10 meters
 - If locked units were levelled up or down, the server didn't invalidate the client changes, so that the unit stayed on the same level on server side and on a different one on client side, causing army controller problems -> this has been fixed

 - If fast game is enabled, predefined set has double stats (6 workers and 2 times as many resources)
 - From now on server handles random tribe selection, and checks if the selected tribe is really allowed on the map and hq location
 - The error which produced the "Your point buy preset is empty..." message (original one was: "no units or resources chosen") won't prevent the player to set ready (because it happened only (?) with Predefined settings and it doesn't make sense to stop the game being started if Server by Predefined setting overwrites the point buy results anyways...)
 - The tribe filter option which was used until now, has been removed
 - Added new Random items with custom filtering to tribe selection drop list

 - CPLX trigger action (create complex unit -> like ship, and inside passengers) had the server side capability to create sub passengers, but the level editor didn't support this functionality -> from now on, each passenger 'token' can be edited manually in a new edit field, which allows to create sub passengers, or simply create passengers from different tribes (requires proper knowledge though)

 - Armour piercing value (since it can be different) will be shown on from now on

 - Flying units were activating water mines by flying over them (although they didn't suffer damage from the explosion) -> this has been fixed (they don't activate the mines anymore)

MIRAGE 2.5.7
------------------
General:
 - Fire damage frequency has been decreased (from ticking each second it does now every 2 seconds)
 - Probably fixed a bug causing client crashes using group hotkeys in certain situations
 - Players without any hq or population buildings/units, will have a minimal of 2 population capacity (so like dustrider can still produce a mobile hq, if they only have a small farm left)
 - Fixed zeppelin corpse's bug, which caused the wreck to move higher first, only then to sink
 - Inventing epoch 2 was too fast for AI (since 2.5.3 probably) so it has been restored to original settings
 - English help file about heroes had parsing error (missing tag), that was why heroes had no names or descriptions  -> this has been fixed
 - Some animals (like kentrosaurus, parasaurolophus units of dc) had gfx issues because of scripting error -> the problem is fixed
 - Formerly if the player wanted to level up a unit by 2 levels (like from AC level 1 to 3) while there were no free slots in the level between (in this case AC level 2) only with a drag-and-drop action on the pyramid card could this be done  -> from now on, right clicking on the pyramid (AC) card, or using the level up command bar button will level up the selected unit to the closest level, if it has a free slot (and the player has enough skulls to do so)
 - From now on, if a player gives his ally shared unit control or takes it back, both players will receive text message about it
 - Set rally point button in command bar could only set the rally target to a position, but not to a target, like a building -> from now on, if the hit object at left clicking is a building, the building itself will be the target
 - Even if a trade building's rally point was set to an own or allied trade building, the newly produced trade units didn't start the trade route immediately, but only after a couple of seconds, while targeting the building which produced them -> this has been 'fixed'
 - If a water trade unit started its route to the target building, but this building has changed its position (floating harbour or carrier) the trade unit once arriving at the target's old position, made the profit and started its way back, although at that location there was nothing to trade with anymore ('the building swam away') -> this has been fixed (if the target building isn't there anymore, the trade unit will go to the target again
 - Zeppelin's boarding mechanic has been changed, so that the potential passengers gather to the same location, while the zeppelin moves to there
 - The last 5 IP addresses - which the player has joined to - are saved from now on, and can be selected in the Join Direct IP window (multiplayer) in a droplets (the number of saved addresses can be increased manually in Settings.cfg)
 - In multiplayer window (opened from main menu) the Internet button has been removed, since gamespy doesn't provide paraworld services anymore -> the Starting button from now on will be Host IP, next will be Join IP and the last is LAN
 - Defence values can be from now on 100(%), which results in full protection against attacks without armour piercing
 - Diplomacy changes didn't update effect regions (like war cry, war paint) which was at the very least unfortunate, but in some cases (like smoke tower's hiding) really bad -> this issue has been solved :)
 - Resurrection started cool down for all abilities of the unit which was brought back to life -> from now on, only the cool downs the unit really had before death will be continued after resurrection
 - Added some basic descriptions to the new hero abilities (they could still be described better)
 - Zeppelin of all tribes got weakened -> hit points have been decreased from 1200/1300/1500/1800/2300 to 200/300/500/800/1300
 - Initial search radius for finding wood to harvest has been increased from 5 to 15 m
 - After clicking on the 'Abandon Game' button in game menu a message box will popup, and ask if the player really wants to abandon the game, so that miss-clicks in game menu won't result in premature game endings (at least less often)
 - Delete function can be disabled in options menu - change applies to both Delete key on keyboard and Del button in command bar
 - Updated a trigger action mechanic, which handled ownership changes (like the player gets units and villages under his control), so that many mission maps will be playable again
 - Updated some other new game mechanics as well, which rendered many campaign missions unplayable
 - Toolkit artefact's effect was not loaded correctly from a save game (mirage related problem) -> this has been fixed
 - From now on repairing buildings takes only half the time than before. Repairing walls or gates is 6 times faster than before
 - After clicking on the 'Retry Game' button in game menu a message box will popup, and ask if the player really wants to retry the game, so that miss-clicks in game menu won't result in accidental game retries (at least less often)
 - Changed how weapon frequency data is displayed in info window's tooltip, so that will be easier to understand (formerly it showed a real number value, like 2.00000, now it will say 30 attacks per minutes)
 - Tower upgrades (nm, dr and dc) conflicted with the fighting task of the respective tower -> this has been fixed

 - Graveyard ability was way too strong, so it got weakened -> only 5 zombies are produced from a single gravestone at a time

 - Arch Druid's level 5 ability, Sacred forest gas been replaced by Fatal Bonds (the forest created by previous ability wasn't blocking the path, so one of its main function was not working, without it, it's a pretty much useless ability - besides, if it was working (could be done) it would be OP)
 - Anaesthetic dart ability had various scripting shortcomings -> these have been fixed

Dragon clan:
 - Battle cruiser was only producible as a level 1 unit, instead of 2 -> this has been fixed

 - If a small tower and a medium tower upgraded from small tower (or normal Tesla~ and Tesla~ upgraded) were selected together, changing the focus (with Tab key) didn't update the info window (and many other things neither) -> this has been fixed
 - Double clicking on upgraded towers many times selected also different towers together -> this has been fixed
 - If to a selection of small towers was added a medium tower (or vice versa the whole...), after changing the focus to medium tower and clicking (or using hotkey) on the Taslow tower upgrade, didn't start the upgrade, while individual producing option was enabled -> it is been fixed (the problem (probably) was also with different dr animal farms in the same selection)

 - Carcha nest could spawn maximal 4 animals -> from now on it can only 3
