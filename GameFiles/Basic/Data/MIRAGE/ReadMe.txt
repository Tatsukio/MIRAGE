 - Updated the description of several units (e.g. some special units don't have certain abilities by now)
 - I did a sloppy work with caching the last (5) used IP addresses (the IP used at joining always got saved again, no matter if it was already, and this way if the same IP is used for several times, the cache would contain only that one, not older but different IP addresses) -> it is working now as it intended to be in the first place
 - Changed how camera style toggling works: the camera styles aren't mixed anymore, if new zooming is disabled, only the old system works and vice versa

 - Since a hotkey for retry button at end screen was added, it could be activated even if it was invisible -> this has been fixed
 - Armour piercing value (since it can be different) will be shown on from now on
 - In multiplayer window (opened from main menu) the Internet button has been restored, because we found a way to replace gamespy functionality. Internet button is now the last (for this to work, you need to have hex edited executables, for more info & help, ask us on the forum)
 - Added new server setting: pause limitation, which means any player can pause the game max. 'x' times
 - Added new server setting: unpause, which allows other players to unpause the game. If pause limit is set, unpausing someone else's pause takes away one tactical pause

 - Added training dummy animals for new units, and for old units which didn't have beforehand (like most dragon clan animals...). Dustrider animal farms keep their gates open, while the training dummy animal is outside. Training dummies gets deleted, before the actual unit appears from now on (it was ugly, when duration was shortened by effects like Ada's T5, or treasures and both the unit and the dummy were visible at the same time.
 - Made a workaround to solve the stacking of air units (also enabled a flight action for most of them when they are in idle state)
 - Flying units were activating water mines by flying over them (although they didn't suffer damage from the explosion) -> this has been fixed (they don't activate the mines anymore)

 - Animation for Governor's Whirlwind ability has been replaced to a proper one
 - Taslow's special, lvl3 ability lacked a position checking function, so even if he didn't arrive at the target's location, the action got still performed, and this allowed it to be exploited (like setting taslow into an area closed off by walls and killing visible enemy vehicles) -> this has been fixed

MIRAGE 2.5.7
------------------
General:
 - Fire damage frequency has been decreased (from ticking each second it does now every 2 seconds)
 - Probably fixed a bug causing client crashes using group hotkeys in certain situations
 - Players without any hq or population buildings/units, will have a minimal of 2 population capacity (so like dustrider can still produce a mobile hq, if they only have a small farm left)
 - Fixed zeppelin corpse's bug, which caused the wreck to move higher first, only then to sink
 - Inventing epoch 2 was too fast for AI (since 2.5.3 probably) so it has been restored to original settings
 - English help file about heroes had parsing error (missing tag), that was why heroes had no names or descriptions  -> this has been fixed
 - Some animals (like kentrosaurus, parasaurolophus units of dc) had gfx issues because of scripting error -> the problem is fixed
 - Formerly if the player wanted to level up a unit by 2 levels (like from AC level 1 to 3) while there were no free slots in the level between (in this case AC level 2) only with a drag-and-drop action on the pyramid card could this be done  -> from now on, right clicking on the pyramid (AC) card, or using the level up command bar button will level up the selected unit to the closest level, if it has a free slot (and the player has enough skulls to do so)
 - From now on, if a player gives his ally shared unit control or takes it back, both players will receive text message about it
 - Set rally point button in command bar could only set the rally target to a position, but not to a target, like a building -> from now on, if the hit object at left clicking is a building, the building itself will be the target
 - Even if a trade building's rally point was set to an own or allied trade building, the newly produced trade units didn't start the trade route immediately, but only after a couple of seconds, while targeting the building which produced them -> this has been 'fixed'
 - If a water trade unit started its route to the target building, but this building has changed its position (floating harbour or carrier) the trade unit once arriving at the target's old position, made the profit and started its way back, although at that location there was nothing to trade with anymore ('the building swam away') -> this has been fixed (if the target building isn't there anymore, the trade unit will go to the target again
 - Zeppelin's boarding mechanic has been changed, so that the potential passengers gather to the same location, while the zeppelin moves to there
 - The last 5 IP addresses - which the player has joined to - are saved from now on, and can be selected in the Join Direct IP window (multiplayer) in a droplets (the number of saved addresses can be increased manually in Settings.cfg)
 - In multiplayer window (opened from main menu) the Internet button has been removed, since gamespy doesn't provide paraworld services anymore -> the Starting button from now on will be Host IP, next will be Join IP and the last is LAN
 - Defence values can be from now on 100(%), which results in full protection against attacks without armour piercing
 - Diplomacy changes didn't update effect regions (like war cry, war paint) which was at the very least unfortunate, but in some cases (like smoke tower's hiding) really bad -> this issue has been solved :)
 - Resurrection started cool down for all abilities of the unit which was brought back to life -> from now on, only the cool downs the unit really had before death will be continued after resurrection
 - Added some basic descriptions to the new hero abilities (they could still be described better)
 - Zeppelin of all tribes got weakened -> hit points have been decreased from 1200/1300/1500/1800/2300 to 200/300/500/800/1300
 - Initial search radius for finding wood to harvest has been increased from 5 to 15 m
 - After clicking on the 'Abandon Game' button in game menu a message box will popup, and ask if the player really wants to abandon the game, so that miss-clicks in game menu won't result in premature game endings (at least less often)
 - Delete function can be disabled in options menu - change applies to both Delete key on keyboard and Del button in command bar
 - Updated a trigger action mechanic, which handled ownership changes (like the player gets units and villages under his control), so that many mission maps will be playable again
 - Updated some other new game mechanics as well, which rendered many campaign missions unplayable
 - Toolkit artefact's effect was not loaded correctly from a save game (mirage related problem) -> this has been fixed
 - From now on repairing buildings takes only half the time than before. Repairing walls or gates is 6 times faster than before
 - After clicking on the 'Retry Game' button in game menu a message box will popup, and ask if the player really wants to retry the game, so that miss-clicks in game menu won't result in accidental game retries (at least less often)
 - Changed how weapon frequency data is displayed in info window's tooltip, so that will be easier to understand (formerly it showed a real number value, like 2.00000, now it will say 30 attacks per minutes)
 - Tower upgrades (nm, dr and dc) conflicted with the fighting task of the respective tower -> this has been fixed
 - Updated copyright's date from 2012 to 2014 at several occurrences

AI:
 - AI players will use flying units (nm and dr pteranodon, battle cruiser) from now on
 - Changed army composition of dustrider AI, so that it will produce more Titans (hopefully)
